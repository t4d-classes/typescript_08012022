# Lab 1 Instructions

1. Fix the code under test to use type declarations. Run the unit test and
   verify it passes.

2. Set a breakpoint in the code at this line:

```typescript
return a + b;
```

Verify the values of the variables `a` and `b` using the debug tools.

3. In the unit test code, add explicit type declarations to the variables
   `a`, `b`, and `result`. What error/warning do you get? Remove the
   explicit type declarations that were added in this step.

4. Write a function and unit test to perform subtraction.
